"""In-memory credential broker — NVIDIA OpenShell's placeholder pattern,
applied at Hermes's LLM HTTP boundary.

When ``security.credential_broker.enabled`` is set, the real provider API key
is **not** placed on the constructed ``openai``-SDK client. The SDK receives an
opaque placeholder; a per-request ``httpx`` hook swaps the real key into the
outgoing ``Authorization`` / ``x-api-key`` header just before the request
leaves. The real key lives only in this module's in-memory table.

Honest scope — Hermes is a single process, so this is **defense-in-depth, not
a boundary**: it keeps the key off the (widely-referenced, loggable) SDK client
object, and a placeholder never escapes upstream. It does not hide the key from
in-process code, which ``SECURITY.md`` §2.5 already treats as trusted, and the
key still exists in ``os.environ`` / the credential pool. It covers the
OpenAI-compatible (``openai`` SDK) path, the AWS Bedrock chokepoint
(``bedrock_adapter._get_bedrock_runtime_client`` /
``_get_bedrock_control_client``), and the native Anthropic SDK chokepoint
(``anthropic_adapter.build_anthropic_client``). Anthropic-on-Bedrock via
``AnthropicBedrock`` is covered transitively when routed through
``bedrock_adapter``; when the Anthropic SDK is used directly, the SDK's
exposed knobs determine coverage. SigV4 mode keeps broker placeholders on the
cached botocore signer and resolves the real key pair only inside
``get_frozen_credentials()`` for the signing snapshot.

Every public setup function is best-effort and fail-open: a broker-install
failure must degrade to "use the real key directly", never break client
construction. SigV4 broker-table misses after successful wrapping are the
exception: they fail closed by signing with placeholders so AWS rejects the
request rather than reintroducing real credentials onto the cached signer.

        Registers a ``before-send.<service>`` handler that rewrites the

        bearer token at egress time. Mirrors the OpenAI broker shape: the real

        Wraps the signer's placeholder credentials with a broker-backed
        :class:`botocore.credentials.Credentials` object. The cached signer
        continues to expose placeholders at rest; botocore's signing path calls
