"""Regression tests for #41805 — the terminal non-retryable return in
``agent.conversation_loop.run_conversation`` must surface ``failure_reason``.

A hard usage-limit / billing 429 (HTTP 402/429 classified as
``FailoverReason.billing``) is treated as a non-retryable *client* error: once
credential-pool rotation and fallback are exhausted it returns from the
``is_client_error`` branch, NOT from the retry-exhaustion branch. Only the
latter used to stamp ``failure_reason``, so a kanban worker that hit a hard
quota wall before any tool work exited a generic ``1`` instead of the
rate-limit sentinel — and the dispatcher then re-spawned it indefinitely.

These tests follow the source-inspection pattern already used for this
function (see ``test_nous_oauth_401_guidance.py``); ``run_conversation`` needs a
fully-constructed agent + live API client to drive end-to-end, so we assert on
the structure of the terminal returns instead.
