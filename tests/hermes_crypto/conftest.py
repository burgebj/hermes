"""Fixtures for the hermes_crypto test suite.

Builds on the hermetic global conftest (isolated HERMES_HOME, scrubbed
credential env vars). Adds two encryption-specific guarantees:

* An **in-memory keyring backend** so keyring-mode tests never read from or
  write to the developer's real OS keyring (Credential Manager / Keychain /
  Secret Service).
* The process-wide DEK cache is cleared around every test so one test's
  unlocked keystore cannot leak into the next.
