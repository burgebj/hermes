  Spending rule and liquidity management layer for the Wake Robin Liquidity
  Architecture. Covers three spending rules (flat-real, smoothing, Owl/
  Guyton-Klinger), the spending base configurable denominator and L19 problem
  (total NAV overstates spendable resources for this SFO), five-tier liquidity
  classification, 18-month reserve floor, manager terms diagnostics (redemption
  notices, lock-ups, gates, side pockets), and workbook integration constraints.

# Spending & Liquidity Skill

## Purpose

Reference for the spending rule and liquidity management layer of the Wake Robin Liquidity Architecture. Critical context: for this multi-entity SFO, total NAV materially overstates spendable resources. Spending and liquidity decisions must be made against a separately-modeled spendable-resource base.

---

## Spending Rules

**ABC**: `src/aa_model/spending/base.py`

### Flat-Real Rule

Fixed real spending amount, adjusted for inflation each quarter.

```
quarterly_spend = annual_spend / 4 * (1 + inflation_rate)^quarters_elapsed
```

Simple, predictable. No NAV sensitivity.

### Smoothing Rule

Weighted average of prior spend and current NAV-implied spend.

```
spend_t = weight * (rate * NAV_t) + (1 - weight) * spend_{t-1}
```

**Known limitation (L7)**: When `weight=0`, spending freezes at initial level regardless of NAV changes. Documented, not a bug.

### Owl / Guyton-Klinger Guardrail Rule

**File**: `src/aa_model/spending/owl_adapter.py`

Advanced guardrail-based withdrawal strategy with prosperity and capital preservation triggers.

**Key behaviors**:
- Initial spend rate applied to spending base
- Prosperity rule: increase spend when portfolio grows above threshold
- Capital preservation rule: decrease spend when portfolio falls below threshold
- Guardrails define maximum and minimum spend adjustments per period

**Phase 11 fix (L16)**: Owl now uses absolute-dollar guardrail thresholds (scale-invariant in initial NAV). Prior version reacted to forecasted NAV, not realized NAV (L15, resolved Phase 4a).

## Spending Base (Phase 12/12.5)

**File**: `src/aa_model/spending/spending_base.py`

### The Core Problem (L19)

Total NAV includes:
- PE fund NAV (illiquid, not spendable)
- Development real estate (land carry, not income-producing)
- OpCo interests (not automatically liquid)

Using total NAV as the spending rate denominator would suggest the family can spend far more than is actually accessible.

### Configurable Denominator

| Base Type | What It Includes | Use Case |
|-----------|-----------------|----------|
| total_nav | Everything | Legacy/simple models |
| liquid_nav | Only liquid buckets | Conservative |
| distributable_income | Income-producing assets only | Most realistic for this SFO |

**Rule**: Spending rate denominator must be explicitly configured, not defaulted to total NAV.

### Distribution Inflow (Phase 13)

`distribution_inflow` is a ledger flow type representing income distributions from illiquid assets that become spendable. Bridges the gap between illiquid NAV and actual spending capacity.

---

## Liquidity Coverage

**File**: `src/aa_model/liquidity/coverage.py`

### Reserve Floor

Default: 18 months of spending in cash + short-term bonds (configurable via `liquidity.floor_months` in base.yaml).

Reserve floor is enforced before rebalancing.

### Coverage Ratios

Per-period obligations vs period-available liquidity by tier.

### Five-Tier Liquidity Classification

| Tier | Granularity | Examples |
|------|------------|---------|
| 1 | Daily | Cash, money market |
| 2 | Monthly | Public equities, liquid bonds |
| 3 | Quarterly | Hedge funds with quarterly redemption |
| 4 | At maturity | Fixed-term vehicles |
| 5 | Locked | PE, development RE, OpCo |

Liquidity tiering must honor the four-line principle.

### Breach Alerts

Triggered when projected outflows exceed tier 1-2 capacity within the planning horizon.

---

## Manager Terms Diagnostics

**File**: `src/aa_model/liquidity/manager_terms_diagnostics.py`

Per-manager liquidity analysis:
- Redemption notice periods
- Lock-up periods
- Gate provisions
- Side pocket exposure
- Effective liquidity tier assignment

---

## Workbook Integration

### Cashflow Modeling v7.xlsx (Read-Only)

Canonical entity-level cash-flow forecast. The model reads, normalizes, and reconciles to it. The model does NOT mutate the workbook.

### Investment Summary Workbook (Read-Only)

Canonical position universe with per-position metadata:
- Liquidity bucket (1-5)
- Liquidity granularity (Daily/Monthly/Quarterly/At Maturity)
- Cash-flow-producing flag
- Time horizon
- Expected standard deviation

---

## Key Constraints

1. Spending rate denominator must be explicitly configured, not defaulted to total NAV
2. All spending flows land on the quarterly ledger as `flow_type = "spend"`
3. Reserve floor is enforced before rebalancing
4. Liquidity tiering must honor the four-line principle
5. Workbook data is read-only; validation divergence is logged, not silently absorbed
