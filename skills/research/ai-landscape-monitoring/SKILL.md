# AI Landscape Monitoring

**Status:** DRAFT / NOT ACTIVE
**Created:** 2026-05-18
**Last Updated:** 2026-05-23

## Purpose

Define the framework for evaluating AI industry developments relevant to Wake Robin's investment and operational activities. Two routines (Friday AI Digest, Weekly AI Research Digest) actively produce AI landscape intelligence; this skill defines *how* to evaluate AI claims, *what* to watch for, and *how* to distinguish hype from genuine capability.

## Evaluation Framework: Hype vs Substance

### The Institutional Rigor Test

Apply CFA-grade skepticism to AI performance claims:

| Question | Red Flag | Green Flag |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Is there out-of-sample evidence? | Only in-sample or backtest | True OOS or live deployment |
| Is it net of costs? | Gross returns only | Net of transaction costs, API costs |
| Is sample size sufficient? | n < 30 or unclear | n > 100, statistically significant |
| Is there regime conditioning? | Only tested in bull markets | Tested across regimes |
| Is the methodology replicable? | Black box, no code | Open source or detailed methodology |
| Is there survivorship bias? | Only surviving companies | Full universe at decision time |
| Who funded the research? | AI vendor self-reporting | Independent academic or practitioner |
| Is the benchmark appropriate? | vs cash or wrong benchmark | vs relevant investable alternative |

### Claim Classification

| Category | Definition | Action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| VALIDATED | Multiple independent confirmations, live deployment, open methodology | Monitor for integration opportunities |
| PROMISING | Strong methodology, limited OOS, no obvious red flags | Track, evaluate in 6 months |
| UNPROVEN | In-sample only, vendor claims, no independent validation | Note, do not cite as evidence |
| HYPE | No methodology, unreplicable claims, obvious conflicts of interest | Ignore, note as cautionary example |
| DEAD | Tested and failed (like Spec 053 options-as-alpha) | Do not revisit without new data |

---

## Notable Industry Signals Log

High-profile claims captured for tracking through the Institutional Rigor Test. Each entry records the source, the claim, initial classification, and what evidence would move it up or down.

### Marc Andreessen on Joe Rogan (May 2026, ~3h20m)

| # | Claim | Initial Classification | Evidence Needed to Upgrade/Downgrade |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | "AGI is here" -- crossed ~3 months ago with GPT-5.5, Claude 4.6, Gemini 3, Grok 4.3 | HYPE | No agreed definition of AGI applied; no benchmark cited; speaker is a16z GP with massive portfolio exposure to the claim being true. Would need independent benchmark suite showing qualitative capability break vs prior generation. |
| 2 | Top AIs give better answers than world-class human experts on almost any topic | UNPROVEN | Anecdotal (n=1 user). Would need controlled expert-vs-LLM comparison studies across domains. Some domain-specific evidence exists (radiology, legal Q&A) but "almost any topic" is unfalsifiable as stated. |
| 3 | Doctors already secretly using ChatGPT in exam rooms | PROMISING | Consistent with AMA 2025 survey (45% of physicians experimenting with LLMs). "Secretly" and "already" overstate adoption curve but directional signal is real. Watch for FDA guidance on clinical LLM use. Investment signal: bullish GH, VCYT, diagnostic AI. |
| 9 | "The only real skill left is knowing what to ask" -- bottleneck is in the user's head | VALIDATED | This is the core thesis behind DEM's skill-encoded domain expertise. The moat for institutional investors is encoding the right questions (clinical pipeline, 13F filing analysis, catalyst timing) into agent prompts. Independently confirmed by production experience. |
| 12 | AI solving 100+ year open math problems; expect cancer cures, new drugs, physics breakthroughs | PROMISING (math) / UNPROVEN (applied science) | AlphaProof/AlphaGeometry IMO results are real. Protein folding (AlphaFold) is real. "Cancer cures" and "weird new physics" within "next few years" is aspirational. Track drug discovery pipeline (Recursion, Insilico) for evidence. |
| 13 | Best AI coders make $50M/year -- signals how big this is | UNPROVEN | No named examples or comp data cited. Directionally consistent with a16z portfolio company comp trends but $50M is an extraordinary claim requiring extraordinary evidence. Watch for public comp disclosures. |
| 16-17 | "AI vampires" running 20 parallel bots; bots-running-bots (1000 AI workers) months away | PROMISING (parallel bots) / UNPROVEN (recursive delegation at scale) | Parallel coding bots are real and in use (Hermes fleet, Cursor multi-agent, Devin). 20 simultaneous is plausible for code review loops. 1000-agent recursive hierarchies "months away" is speculative -- context window limits, error propagation, and coordination overhead are unsolved at that scale. |
| 14 | $200 DNA decode + AI health dashboard from DNA + blood + wearable data | PROMISING | Whole genome sequencing is ~$200 (Nebula, Dante Labs). LLM interpretation of combined genomic + phenotypic data is early but real. Clinical validity of AI-generated health recommendations from consumer genomics is UNPROVEN. Watch FDA regulation of DTC genomic AI interpretation. |

**Net assessment:** Andreessen is a16z's chief evangelist; every claim benefits his portfolio. Apply maximum conflict-of-interest discount. That said, claims #3 (medical AI adoption), #9 (question-asking as bottleneck), and #16 (parallel agent orchestration) are directionally validated by independent evidence and DEM production experience. Track #12 and #14 for biotech investment signal.

## Competitive Positioning

### Hermes vs Commercial Alternatives (May 2026)

| System | Architecture | Differentiator | Concern |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Hermes/OpenClaw (DEM) | 30-agent fleet, repo-governed, CCFT | Full governance control, audit trail | Operator-dependent, WSL2 infrastructure |
| Town AI Assistant | Cloud SaaS, routine-based, multi-platform | Graduated autonomy, meeting capture, audio briefings, 39 skills, persistent memory | Integration breadth (~12 vs 200+), near-zero market visibility, post-beta pricing unknown, platform dependency risk |
| Nous Research Hermes | Self-learning skills, MIT license | Skill auto-creation, large community | Governance-incompatible with CCFT (unreviewed skill mutations) |
| ChatGPT/Claude direct | Single model, conversational | Ease of use, frontier capability | No persistent memory, no governance |
| Bloomberg Terminal AI | Integrated data + AI | Data advantage | Closed ecosystem, no customization |
| Kensho/S&P AI | NLP on financial documents | Scale, data coverage | Enterprise pricing, no biotech specialization |

### DEM Competitive Advantages

1. **Governance-first:** Every signal change goes through Checklist v2, spec system, and operator approval
2. **PIT-safe by design:** No other system enforces point-in-time as rigorously
3. **Domain-specialized:** 48-manager biotech hedge fund registry, clinical trial pipeline integration
4. **Transparent:** All scoring rules encoded in skills, all evidence documented

### DEM Competitive Disadvantages

1. **Single-operator dependency:** Darren is sole governance authority
2. **Infrastructure fragility:** WSL2 on Windows, sleep-cliff risk, Herald DARK 5+ weeks
3. **No live trading integration:** Shadow portfolio only (Alpaca API available but not wired)
4. **Limited NLP:** No earnings call NLP, no news sentiment (Herald pipeline is down)

Gmail, Google Calendar, Google Drive, Google Docs, Slack, Notion, Dropbox, GitHub, Linear, HubSpot, Asana, MCP protocol servers (extensible). ~12 named integrations vs Lindy's 200+.

#### Town vs AI Email/Productivity Competitor Landscape (2026)

**Three competitive camps:**

1. **Full Workflow Automation (Agents):** Lindy, Consul, Carly -- autonomous agents acting across apps
2. **AI-First Email Clients:** Superhuman, Shortwave, Spark -- replace email interface with AI-enhanced version
3. **Assistant Layers:** SaneBox, Fyxer, Gemini, Copilot -- augment existing inbox

**Town straddles camps 1 and 3** -- works within existing tools (not a replacement client) but offers full workflow automation with graduated autonomy.

| Dimension | Town | Lindy ($50/mo) | Superhuman ($30/mo) | Shortwave ($8-24/mo) | Consul | Fyxer ($22/mo) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Autonomy levels | 3 modes, per-tool | Full agent | Hybrid (user-initiated) | Hybrid | Approval-only | Limited |
| Email triage | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Voice-matched drafting | Yes (deep) | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Workflow/routine builder | Yes (trigger-based) | Yes (visual) | No | No | Tasklets | No |
| Meeting transcription | Yes (iOS capture) | No | No | No | No | No |
| Audio briefings | Yes | No | No | No | No | No |
| Calendar management | Deep (CRUD + RSVP) | Basic | No | No | Yes | No |
| Per-tool permissions | Yes | Limited | No | No | No | No |
| Persistent memory | Profile + memories | Some | Limited | Limited | Some | No |
| Integration count | ~12 | 200+ | ~5 | Gmail only | ~6 | ~3 |
| Multi-platform | 6 channels | Web, email | Web, iOS, desktop | Web, iOS | Web | Web |
| Pricing | Free (open beta) | $49.99/mo | $30-33/user/mo | $8.50-24/seat/mo | TBD | $22.50/mo |

#### Town Competitive Advantages (vs field)

1. **Graduated autonomy with per-tool granularity** -- 3-mode system more nuanced than any competitor. Lindy is all-or-nothing; Consul is approval-only; Superhuman/Shortwave require human initiation.
2. **Meeting capture + audio briefings** -- No major competitor combines voice recording, transcription, structured notes, and generated audio briefings.
3. **Multi-channel access** -- Web + email + Slack + iOS + WhatsApp + desktop is broadest access surface in category.
4. **Free during beta** -- Every named competitor charges $8.50-$50/month.
5. **Persistent memory architecture** -- User profile + routine-specific memories deeper than competitors' tone matching.
6. **Founding team pedigree** -- Ex-CTO Plaid + ex-Google AI Director + $18M from First Round Capital.

#### Town Competitive Disadvantages (vs field)

1. **Integration breadth** -- ~12 named vs Lindy's 200+. Significant gap for cross-app workflow users.
2. **Market visibility** -- Absent from every major 2026 AI email assistant comparison guide reviewed (Zapier, Superhuman blog, Resident, Smartpostly, aitoolbriefing, etc.).
3. **Review footprint** -- No G2/Capterra/TrustRadius listings, no Product Hunt launch, minimal HN/Reddit discussion. Social proof near zero.
4. **Enterprise features** -- No visible SSO, admin controls, or compliance features in public materials (team routines exist but not marketed).
5. **Post-beta pricing unknown** -- Free beta is an advantage now but creates uncertainty for long-term planning.
6. **Pivot residue** -- Tax-to-assistant pivot may create brand confusion (efficient.app 2026 review still describes Town as tax advisory).

#### Town Relevance to DEM Operations

Town is the **primary operator interface** for Darren's investment workflow. Current operational role:

- Receives Hermes email output (Herald Digest, Bellringer, PDUFA alerts, 13F scans) via djschulz@gmail.com
- Runs 20+ routines (morning briefings, catalyst tracking, 13F monitoring, intraday movers, drift baselines, SEC EDGAR scans)
- Maintains persistent memory (20+ global preferences, routine-specific memories)
- Stores structured knowledge in Content Library (biotech-screener, investment-frameworks, ai-projects collections)
- Provides chat-based operator interface for ad-hoc research, drafting, calendar management
- Hosts 39 skills (as of May 2026) that encode DEM methodology

**Assessment (Institutional Rigor Test):**

- Claim classification: **PROMISING** -- strong team, funded, differentiated features, but limited independent validation and near-zero market visibility
- Watch for: post-beta pricing, integration expansion, appearance in major comparison guides, enterprise feature development
- Risk: single-platform dependency for DEM operations (Town + Hermes is the full stack; if Town pivots again or changes pricing, operational disruption is material)

## Cost-Performance Benchmarking

### API Cost Context (May 2026)

| Provider | Model | Cost (per 1M tokens) | Use |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Together AI | Llama 3.3 70B | ~$0.30-0.60 | Primary Hermes inference |
| Anthropic | Claude Sonnet | ~$3-15 | Fallback, complex analysis |
| OpenRouter | Various | Credits exhausted | Former primary |

### Local LLM Decision (D-2026-007)

DEM Tier 6 decision: local LLMs deferred. Breakeven vs frontier APIs is 3-6 months on DGX Spark ($3K). Against cheap open-weight cloud APIs, local never breaks even within hardware life. Qwen 2.5 Coder 32B scores 9.3/10 on tool calling but requires 24GB+ VRAM (current: 16GB).

## Key Constraints

1. AI landscape intelligence is for INFORMING decisions, not for automated action
2. All AI performance claims must pass the Institutional Rigor Test before being cited
3. Hermes competitive analysis must be honest about disadvantages, not just advantages
4. Cost-performance benchmarking should be updated quarterly as API pricing changes
5. The AI bubble/skeptic perspective is tracked alongside positive developments -- both lenses matter
