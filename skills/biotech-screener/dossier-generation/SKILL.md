# Dossier Generation Skill

## Purpose

Generate investment dossiers and IC (Investment Committee) memos from pipeline output. This skill defines the structure, cadence, and content requirements for transforming raw screening results into actionable investment documents.

## Preconditions

- Pipeline run has completed successfully (all audit stages OK).
- Governance metadata is present in screening output.
- All scores referenced in the dossier are from the same `as_of_date`.
- No future data has leaked into the scoring (PIT-verified).

## Weekly Cadence

| Day | Activity | Owner |
|-----|---------|-------|
| Tuesday | Machine processing: full pipeline run, data collection, scoring | Automated |
| Wednesday | Human scoring: manual review of flagged tickers, override decisions | Analyst |
| Thursday | IC presentation: ranked portfolio, position sizing, risk overlays | Committee |

## Expected Return Model

```
Score -> Rank -> Percentile (Blom plotting position)
Percentile -> Z-score (Acklam inverse normal)
Z-score -> Expected excess return = z * lambda * (12 / holding_period_months)
```

- **DEFAULT_LAMBDA_ANNUAL**: 0.08 (8% per 1-sigma per year)
- **Model ID**: zscore_linear_lambda v1.0.0

---

## Output Format Requirements

1. All monetary values in USD with commas (e.g., $1,234,567)
2. All scores to 2 decimal places
3. All percentages to 1 decimal place
4. All dates in ISO 8601
5. Governance block attached to every output document
