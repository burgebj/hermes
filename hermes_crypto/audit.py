"""Structured security-audit log for encryption-at-rest events.

Inspired by NVIDIA OpenShell's OCSF event auditing — adapted to a single,
dependency-free JSONL file rather than the full OCSF schema. One JSON object
per line is appended to ``<HERMES_HOME>/logs/security-audit.jsonl``. When the
active file reaches 10 MiB it rolls over into numbered segments (``.1`` …
``.5``); older segments are dropped once the retention cap is reached.

What this log is for: knowing *when* the keystore was unlocked, enabled,
disabled, or rotated — and, importantly, when an unlock **failed**, which is
the signal that someone is trying keys against your encrypted data.

Hard rule: this log records **events, never key material**. Callers pass only
non-secret descriptive detail (slot type, key source, file count). Mirrors the
discipline of ``agent/redact.py``.

Every function here is best-effort and never raises — an audit-write failure
must not break an encryption operation.
