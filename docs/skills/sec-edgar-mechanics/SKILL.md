# SEC EDGAR Mechanics

**Status:** DRAFT / NOT ACTIVE
**Created:** 2026-05-18

## Purpose

Encode the mechanical rules for interacting with SEC EDGAR -- API conventions, filing type taxonomy, CIK resolution, parsing patterns, and dedup logic. This skill supports the institutional-signal pipeline and the three SEC filing routines (13F Monitor, 13D/13G Monitor, Full Registry).

---

## EDGAR API Conventions

### Fair-Use Policy

SEC requires a valid `User-Agent` header identifying the requester. Format:
```
User-Agent: CompanyName AdminContact@company.com
```

SEC_USER_AGENT preflight check added 2026-05-13 to all EDGAR requests. Requests without a valid User-Agent are throttled or blocked.

### Rate Limiting

- Maximum 10 requests per second to EDGAR
- Respect `Retry-After` headers
- Exponential backoff on 429/503 responses
- EDGAR is a public service -- do not abuse it

### Key Endpoints

| Endpoint | Use |
| --- | --- |
| `efts.sec.gov/LATEST/search-index` | Full-text search across filings |
| `data.sec.gov/submissions/CIK{cik}.json` | Filing history by CIK |
| `www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/browse-edgar` | Legacy search interface |
| `efts.sec.gov/LATEST/xbrl-inline` | Inline XBRL data |

---

## Filing Type Taxonomy

### Institutional Holdings (Quarterly)

| Filing | Full Name | Who Files | When | Threshold |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 13F-HR | Institutional Investment Manager Report | Managers with $100M+ AUM | 45 days after quarter-end | $100M AUM |
| 13F-HR/A | Amendment to 13F-HR | Same | After original, correcting errors | Same |

**Filing lag:** SEC_13F_FILING_LAG_DAYS = 45 (built-in constant). Q1 deadline ~May 15, Q2 ~Aug 14, Q3 ~Nov 14, Q4 ~Feb 14.

**Filing pattern:** Filings cluster in the final 3 business days before the deadline. Monitor EDGAR starting ~3 days before deadline.

### Ownership Crossings (Event-Driven)

| Filing | Trigger | Timing | Key Signal |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 13D | Acquire > 5% with activist intent | 10 days after crossing | Activist position, potential campaign |
| 13D/A | Amendment to 13D | Material changes | Position change, intent update |
| 13G | Acquire > 5%, passive intent | 45 days after calendar year-end (or 10 days after crossing 10%) | Passive large holder |
| 13G/A | Amendment to 13G | Annual or upon material change | Position update |

### Insider Transactions

| Filing | Who Files | When | Key Signal |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Form 4 | Officers, directors, 10% holders | 2 business days after transaction | Insider buy/sell activity |

**DEM usage:** `insider_net_buy_value_90d` (Spec 104, DIAGNOSTIC ONLY). Tracks net insider purchase value over trailing 90 days. Blank = not fetched; 0.0 = fetched, no activity.

### Regulatory

| Filing | Use |
| --- | --- |
| Form ADV | Investment advisor registration, AUM disclosure |
| Form ADV/A | Annual amendment |

---

## CIK Resolution

CIK (Central Index Key) is the unique SEC identifier for each filer.

### Lookup Methods

1. **Manager registry:** `production_data/manager_registry.json` maps firm names to CIKs
2. **EDGAR company search:** `www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/browse-edgar?company=&CIK={name}&type=13F`
3. **Submissions API:** `data.sec.gov/submissions/CIK{cik_padded}.json` (10-digit zero-padded)

### Key CIKs (Priority Firms)

| Firm | CIK |
| --- | --- |
| Fairmount Funds Management | 0001802528 |
| Deep Track Capital | 0001856083 |
| Logos Global Management | 0001792126 |

### CIK Rules

- Always zero-pad to 10 digits for API calls: `CIK0001802528`
- CIKs are stable -- they do not change when firms rename
- One CIK per legal entity; multiple funds under one manager share a CIK for 13F purposes
- Some managers file through multiple CIKs (e.g., Foresite Capital IV/V/VI have separate CIKs)

---

## CUSIP-First Reasoning

**Rule from institutional-signal:** Always reason from CUSIP to canonical ticker, never the reverse.

- Holdings in 13F-HR XML are identified by CUSIP, not ticker
- CUSIP-to-ticker mapping can change (ticker changes, corporate actions)
- The canonical summary (`institutional_summary.json`) maintains the CUSIP-to-ticker mapping
- Raw EDGAR XML is debug-only -- never build narratives from raw filing parses

---

## Accession Number Dedup

Accession numbers uniquely identify each filing. Format: `{filer-id}-{year}-{sequence}` (e.g., `0001104659-26-062419`).

### Dedup Protocol

1. When a filing is processed and alerted, store its accession number in a memory
2. Before alerting on a filing, check if its accession number has already been processed
3. If the accession number exists in memories, skip the alert (do not re-alert)
4. Memories include the date processed and the alert target (email recipient)

### Current Dedup State

Stored in global memories. Categories:
- Logos 13G/A filings (May 15, 2026): 4 accession numbers
- Deep Track 13G/A filings (May 15/May 8/May 12, 2026): 12 accession numbers
- Fairmount 13G/A and 13D/A filings (May 15/May 4, 2026): 3 accession numbers
- Q1 2026 13F-HR mass filing (May 15, 2026): 45 accession numbers across 48 registry managers

## 13F-HR Parsing

### XML Structure

13F-HR filings contain an information table in XML format listing all holdings:

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| nameOfIssuer | Company name |
| titleOfClass | Security class (e.g., COM, SHS) |
| cusip | 9-character CUSIP |
| value | Market value in thousands ($) |
| sshPrnamt | Share count |
| sshPrnamtType | Share type (SH = shares) |
| investmentDiscretion | SOLE, SHARED, or DEFINED |
| votingAuthority | Sole, shared, none vote counts |

### Holdings Truth Source

`production_data/institutional_summary.json` is canonical. If raw EDGAR XML count differs from summary count, investigate the summary pipeline first (not the raw filing).

## Filing Cycle Operations

### Pre-Refresh Readiness (5 guards)

Run `tools/prep_13f_refresh.py` before processing new filings:

1. Most recent snapshot has valid `institutional_summary_delta.json`
2. `coinvest_score_z` has healthy variance (SD > 0.10)
3. PIT cache has entries within 3 days of today
4. SEC EDGAR endpoint is reachable
5. Dry-run: `build_institutional_summary()` produces valid output (>=80% coverage)

### Post-Filing Action Sequence

1. Warm 13F cache (`tools/warm_13f_cache.py`)
2. Run cohort quarantine (`tools/check_13f_cohort_quarantine.py`)
3. Check collapse guards (coinvest_score_z SD)
4. Refresh IC decomposition
5. 5-day observation window before treating as production-grade

### Manager Registry

**File:** `production_data/manager_registry.json`
**Never edit directly** -- use `tools/onboard_manager.py`
**Current state:** 48 managers (42 elite_core + 6 conditional)
